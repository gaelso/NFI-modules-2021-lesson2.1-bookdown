## Introduction

**Welcome to the second lesson** of the National Forest Inventory eLearning practice simulation module.

This interactive module is designed to complement the National Forest Inventory eLearning Modules with practical hands-on exercises on a fictional island that just emerged in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean: `Louland`. The lesson 2: **simple sampling for carbon** focuses on several sampling methods that we called "simple sampling" as they are based on the simple random sampling statistics. 

If you have not completed the lesson 1: *Overview of the preliminary data*, we encourage you to start there. Lesson 1 provides a small overview of `Louland` and introduces how you will interact with R consoles embedded in the lesson.

The above link starts the handbook with solutions for the first part of this lesson 2. The objectives of part 1 are:

- Estimate a number of random samples based on a precision/cost trade-off (cost being simplified to the number of plots that we can afford for now),
- Find a sampling grid size for a systematic sampling closest to the estimated number of samples. 
- Create a simple random sampling and an uneven systematic sampling with the same number of plots.
- Compare the distribution of plots per forest category for these three type of simple sampling designs.
