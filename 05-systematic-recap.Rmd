# Systematic sampling: Recap {#sysrecap}

`r ifelse(book_format == "html" & with_watermark, "<div class='watermark'>DRAFT</div>", "")`

Based on the preliminary inventory and few R skills, we have now identified a good sampling grid. To recap the process was:

1. We used the **preliminary forest inventory** results to calculate a an hypothetical number of samples required for a desired precision of 5, 10, 15 or 20%.
1. Based on our available budget we have identified what precision we can afford annd how many plots does it requires, *i.e.* our **sampling size**.
1. We have then created different **sampling grids** for `r newland_name` and estimated how many plots would fall on forest land.
1. We have selected the most adequate sampling grid based on our **cost/precision trade-off**.


<txt-green> Now let's see how the same amount of sampling points would be distributed with a random sampling or with an uneven systematic sampling.</txt-green>
