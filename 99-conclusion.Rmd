This is the end of the lesson 2, part 1. In this lesson we have tested different sampling designs based on the sampling size calculated for simple random sampling and applicable to systematic and uneven systematic sampling. We have seen that considerations for choosing our method among these simple sampling designs were not related to differences in plot distribution per land cover class but rather to statistics concepts such as autocorrelation and how systematic grids are in facts samples of size one.

In the part 2 of this lesson 2, we will get the tree and plot data from the NFI crews for our uneven systematic sampling design and start the data analysis.

A plot distribution proportional to land cover class relative areas is not always desirable. The main goal of sampling optimization is to get the best precision possible with the lowest number of plots to measure.  

From the sampling size formula for Simple Random Sampling (see section \@ref(size)), it is easy to understand that the the number of plots to measure increases with the variability of our main variable of interest (represented by its coefficient of variation $CV$).

If, for example, a population with a rather high $CV$ could be divided into two sub-populations with each a very low $CV$, we can intuitively understand that a small number of plot in each sub-population, and therefore a smaller overall number of plots, could give us a good precision. 

Similarly, if one of the sub-population has a higher $CV$ than the other, and **even if its relative area is smaller comparatively smaller**, allocating a higher number of plots to this sub-population will increase the overall precision.

Our "simple" sampling methods gave sample allocation to land cover classes more or less proportional to their relative areas. It means a very small number of plots in Mangrove forest and a high number of plots in Mixed-Deciduous forest. However, the aboveground biomass $CV$ in Mangrove forests may very well be much higher than in Mixed-Deciduous forests. In this case, a sampling strategy that would give more plots to Mangrove and less to Mixed-Deciduous forests would increase the overall precision of our aboveground biomass and be more cost-efficient.

These strategies are called <txt-green>Stratified Sampling</txt-green> and will be the main topic of another interactive lesson.

For now, we will continue with our uneven systematic sampling design, based on 4 x 4 km grid.
