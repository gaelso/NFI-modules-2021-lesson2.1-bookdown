`r ifelse(book_format == "html" & with_watermark, "<div class='watermark'>DRAFT</div>", "")`

As we have seen in the NFI eLearning Modules, NFIs are multi-purpose in nature, but the sampling design requires that we focus on one main variable of interest. In this lesson, <txt-green>the main variable of interest is the forest mean aboveground biomass</txt-green> of `r newland_name`. 

Here, we will limit ourselves to random and systematic sampling, and we will obtain aboveground biomass estimates for each forest type through post-stratification.

If you have not completed lesson 1: *Overview of the preliminary data*, we encourage you to start there. Lesson 1 provides a small overview of `r newland_name` and introduces how you will interact with the R consoles that are embedded in this document.

Lesson 2 is divided into two parts:

1. Sampling design
1. Data analysis

We will now bagin part 1. We will develop a <txt-green>sampling design</txt-green> for estimating the mean carbon stock of `r newland_name`'s forests in ton/ha. The objectives of part 1 are:

- Estimate sample size based on a precision/cost trade-off (cost being simplified to the number of plots that we can afford for now),
- Find a sampling grid size for a systematic sampling, closest to the estimated number of samples. 
- Create a simple random sampling with the same number of plots.
- Compare the distribution of plots per forest category for these two types of simple sampling designs.

Please note that nowadays many countries do not use these sampling design methods due to several inconveniences. These designs are often not optimal, as different sub-populations have different variability, and taking variability into consideration allows for more optimal designs (See module 3 on Sampling for more information).

However, since the calculations for the estimations resulting from these sampling methods are fairly simple, they constitute a good entry point to sampling and we will start from there. More advanced sampling design methods for NFI, *i.e.* stratified and ratio estimators, are the focus of other interactive lessons.

In this lesson, we will use the collection of packages grouped inside the package `tidyverse` for general data analysis and the package `sf` for spatial data analysis. We will also briefly use the package `units` to avoid confusion around area units.

```{r libs, eval=F}

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(units)

```

Note that in the background we also use `extrafont` to add Google Fonts to our figures and `ggspatial` to add the North arrow and scale to our maps.

<txt-green>Let's get started!</txt-green>
